      <p>Heya, I'm Lenticat!</p>
      <p>As you can tell, I have a mirror of OMFGDOGS on my site.</p>
	  <p>I've been wanting to donate to help keep the dogs running, but I have no way to donate money.</p>
	  <p>So as a way to give back to the people who made my favorite website, I decided to mirror the original page here.</p>
	  <p>This way, even if the dogs stop running there, people can still watch the dogs run here.</p>
	  <p>If you can, please go donate to the people who made OMFGDOGS at the original site.</p>
	  <a href='http://omfgdogs.com'>Original Site</a>
	  <p>I have removed the donation links from the mirror, as I don't want people to think I've tampered with the links in any way.</p>
	  <p>P.S. If you own the OMFGDOGS site, and want me to take down the mirror, please contact me at</p>
